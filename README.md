My journey in the tech world has been a fascinating one. I still remember the days when fat clients and desktop applications ruled the computing world, shaping the very landscape of offices. Back then, I was immersed in the world of legacy technologies, working with Visual Basic 6, Visual C++ 6, MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), and COM (Component Object Model). It was an era of building robust desktop applications, where the user experience was largely dependent on the capabilities of the client-side software.

As the industry evolved, a seismic shift occurred with the rise of web technologies and the emergence of JavaScript as a powerful force in application development. Witnessing this transformation, I embraced the potential of web apps and the new possibilities they offered. I saw the web as a platform that could deliver applications to a wider audience, accessible from any device with an internet connection.

Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering web and mobile development, exploring frameworks such as Angular, NestJS, and .NET, along with their respective ecosystems. I have migrated numerous legacy software stacks from technologies like MFC, COM, and Visual Basic to more modern .NET and JVM stacks. This process involved re-architecting and refactoring applications, ensuring their scalability, maintainability, and performance in the modern digital landscape.

My relationship with JavaScript started around 2011, and since then, I've ventured deep into its ecosystem, gaining extensive knowledge of Node.js and its C++ API. This has been instrumental in creating high-performance server-side applications and harnessing the power of JavaScript on the backend.

Along the way, I've kept pace with the evolving cloud landscape, working with various cloud platforms such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS). These platforms have enabled me to build highly scalable systems that leverage the power of the cloud, ensuring seamless performance and availability.

In the realm of security, I prioritize secure coding practices, penetration testing, and adhering to OWASP guidelines. I have implemented robust authentication and access control mechanisms using tools like Keycloak, LDAP, Active Directory, Firebase, OpenID Connect, and OAuth2. These technologies provide the foundation for secure and reliable user authentication and authorization.

## üíº Experiences & Skills

The diverse experiences I've had over the years, both as an employee and as an entrepreneur, have broadened my perspective and enriched my skills. This journey has instilled in me a sense of adaptability and honed my technical abilities.

I've been running my own software development firm, focusing on creating digital products that truly resonate with customers. This venture not only allows me to utilize my technical skills to the fullest but also provides an opportunity to build leadership and business acumen.

I've realized that a solid architectural foundation is paramount for efficient software development. Hence, I've adopted best practices like Clean Architecture, Ports & Adapters Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design. These paradigms contribute to the maintainability, testability, and long-term resilience of software solutions.

I've also worked extensively with DevExpress and its JavaScript variant, DevExtreme, to build comprehensive, high-performance web applications. Similarly, KendoUI and Telerik, renowned for their rich set of UI controls, have been a part of my toolbox for front-end development.

With the increasing importance of DevOps in software development cycles, I've developed tools to facilitate daily DevOps tasks and offer a [miniDevOps](https://github.com/brakmic/miniDevOps) Docker image as part of my contributions to the community.

Lastly, a highlight from my early career includes [tutorials](https://github.com/brakmic/bazaar/tree/master/webassembly) on WebAssembly, which I wrote in 2015 when it was still relatively unknown. These tutorials reflect my curiosity and dedication to learning emerging technologies.

## üéØ Future Goals

My goal for the future is to continue enhancing my understanding of scalable architectures. The prospect of building resilient, efficient, and maintainable systems capable of adapting to evolving business needs motivates me to continually learn and grow.
