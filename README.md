## üíº Experiences & Skills

Running my own software development firm has provided an invaluable opportunity to build leadership skills, manage diverse projects, and gain an in-depth understanding of business processes. In the pursuit of delivering top-quality software, I've adopted best practices like Clean Architecture, Ports & Adapters Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design. I've had the chance to work with UI control suites like DevExpress, DevExtreme, KendoUI, and Telerik to deliver high-performance web applications.

My familiarity with DevOps has not only helped streamline software development cycles but also fostered a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams. I've contributed to this field by developing tools that facilitate daily DevOps tasks and sharing a [miniDevOps](https://github.com/brakmic/miniDevOps) Docker image with the community.

## üõ†Ô∏è Navigating the .NET Landscape

Since 2004, .NET and C# have been an integral part of my developer journey. Initially, I leveraged Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), along with Silverlight, to build engaging service-oriented applications. 

Data access became simplified with Entity Framework, while Language Integrated Query (LINQ) added a new level of efficiency to my process. As the ecosystem evolved, I transitioned from WCF to ASP.NET and MVC, embracing their clear structure and modern approach. 

This ongoing journey with .NET has fostered in me an ability to adapt to technological shifts, and consistently refine my knowledge and skills.

## üåê Web and Mobile Development Journey

Web and mobile development have been at the heart of my technical journey. The world of Angular, NestJS, and .NET has been my playground where I've learned to create highly efficient and scalable web and mobile applications. This not only means writing great code but also comprehending the complexities of user interface design, API integration, and database management.

## üóÑÔ∏è Crafting APIs

An integral part of my journey has been the development of robust and user-friendly APIs. My experiences with GraphQL, gRPC, and OpenAPI have collectively shaped my ability to build versatile and performant interfaces. These technologies have enabled me to craft APIs that provide a seamless communication layer between different software components, with an emphasis on transparency, efficient performance, and comprehensive documentation. While each project has its unique challenges and learning curves, the journey through these technologies has been a gratifying part of my career growth.

## üöÄ Journey from JavaScript to TypeScript

In the landscape of web development, I've had a rich journey that began with JavaScript. I've greatly enjoyed exploring the capabilities of Node.js and its C++ API. Watching JavaScript evolve from a mere scripting language into a platform capable of building robust server-side applications has been truly intriguing.

As my projects increased in complexity and scale, however, I recognized the limitations JavaScript posed for maintaining large codebases. This led to my switch to TypeScript, a decision not influenced solely by TypeScript's strong typing and enhanced scalability, but also by a concurrent shift in my frontend development preferences.

In the past, I've worked extensively with BackboneJS, Angular 1.x (now known as AngularJS), and KnockoutJS. Each framework offered unique insights, shaping my understanding of frontend development. But with time, my preference solidified around Angular for its robustness and its harmonious synergy with TypeScript. This blend of TypeScript and Angular has equipped me to create more scalable, maintainable, and high-performing web applications.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Managing Deployment and Infrastructure

I have also gained valuable experience in managing application deployment and infrastructures. My proficiency in Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, and KNative is the result of countless hours spent on refining cloud infrastructures to ensure seamless application deployments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Prioritizing Security

I believe secure software is the foundation of any technology we build. Therefore, I've always prioritized mastering secure coding practices, penetration testing, and adhering to OWASP guidelines. Implementing robust authentication and access control mechanisms is something I've extensively worked on, exploring tools like Keycloak, LDAP, Active Directory, Firebase, OpenID Connect, and OAuth2.

## ü§ñ Delving into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Having [always](https://blog.brakmic.com/data-science-for-losers-part-4-machine-learning/) [been](https://blog.brakmic.com/data-science-for-losers-part-6-azure-ml/) [intrigued](https://blog.brakmic.com/data-science-for-losers-part-7-using-azure-ml/) by the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), I've taken steps to integrate these cutting-edge technologies into my projects. My [explorations in this domain](https://github.com/brakmic/SKPlayground) have included working with OpenAI's GPT models, Hugging Face Transformers, and other open source Language Models. These experiences have provided me a solid grounding in the current state of NLP and ML frameworks, enabling me to leverage their capabilities in real-world projects.

## üéØ Future Goals

As I look to the future, my goal is to deepen my understanding of scalable architectures and continue building resilient, efficient, and maintainable systems. It's the joy of learning new things and the thrill of overcoming challenges that drive me forward in this ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.
