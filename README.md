Web and mobile development have been at the heart of my technical journey. The world of Angular, NestJS, and .NET has been my playground where I've learned to create highly efficient and scalable web and mobile applications. This not only means writing great code but also comprehending the complexities of user interface design, API integration, and database management.

In the field of JavaScript, I have enjoyed exploring the vast landscape of Node.js and its C++ API. JavaScript has indeed transformed from being a mere scripting language to a platform for building full-fledged server-side applications. It is intriguing to observe how JavaScript has unlocked avenues for innovation in the software realm.

I have also gained valuable experience in managing application deployment and infrastructures. My proficiency in Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, and KNative is the result of countless hours spent on refining cloud infrastructures to ensure seamless application deployments. 

I believe secure software is the foundation of any technology we build. Therefore, I've always prioritized mastering secure coding practices, penetration testing, and adhering to OWASP guidelines. Implementing robust authentication and access control mechanisms is something I've extensively worked on, exploring tools like Keycloak, LDAP, Active Directory, Firebase, OpenID Connect, and OAuth2.

## üíº Experiences & Skills

Running my own software development firm has provided an invaluable opportunity to build leadership skills, manage diverse projects, and gain an in-depth understanding of business processes. In the pursuit of delivering top-quality software, I've adopted best practices like Clean Architecture, Ports & Adapters Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design. I've had the chance to work with UI control suites like DevExpress, DevExtreme, KendoUI, and Telerik to deliver high-performance web applications.

My familiarity with DevOps has not only helped streamline software development cycles but also fostered a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams. I've contributed to this field by developing tools that facilitate daily DevOps tasks and sharing a [miniDevOps](https://github.com/brakmic/miniDevOps) Docker image with the community.
